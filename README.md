# RCO - Roblox Case Opener [Public]

A Roblox themed case opener/economy [Discord](https://discord.gg) bot created using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) and Discord.js-commando

## Story behind this project
I was fairly new to JavaScript before creating this project. This project was started in order to help me learn JavaScript. The code is messy but it worked.
Before terminating it was in a total of 670 servers. 

## Contact
I am happy to answer any questions related to the code but please note, you should have a strong understanding of the basic concepts of JavaScript and the Discord.js library as well as understand how to create a bot client before using this code.

You can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_VAL_Is_Me_) or comment on this repo.

I have terminated development of this bot so please feel free to create something better from this code.
